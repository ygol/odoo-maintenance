       This module is maintained from: https://github.com/vertelab/odoo-maintenance/ \n 
       until https://github.com/camptocamp/odoo-cloud-platform/tree/14.0/monitoring_status has lifted it.\n
       Inspired by Camptocamp SA.\n
       
       Purpose of this module is to answer with a json object the status of the database, on or off. To query the database you need to go to the /monitoring/status url.
       Url Syntax: http ://hostname/monitoring/status?db=databasename\n
       
       In order for the database to be able to answer without being logged in on you need to change the odoo.conf and add this module to the server_wide_modules.
